## Blog Prompt 13

Read the following:
- [Chapter 5 in the Art of Community: Supporting Workflow with Tools and Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EI6YcKlTdzojLD4RdVjYVlmFRTNzzge0/view?usp=sharing)
- [Git Branches vs Forks](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/branch-or-fork-your-repository-221450630.html)
- [The Definitive Guide to Forks and Branches in Git](https://blog.gitprime.com/the-definitive-guide-to-forks-and-branches-in-git/)

In your thirteenth blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
- As you read chapter 5 in Art of Community, consider each of the very large number of subtopics in this reading. Hint: you might jot down notes as you read because there are more subtopics than it looks like from the chapter outline. Choose the top **six** of topics in the chapter that seem the **most related** to contributing to Open Source and/or with open source contributions to Runestone in particular. Explain why you selected each of these topics and how each is relevant.
- Describe a scenario or two in which it would be best to use a branch and another scenario or two in which it would be better to use just a fork. Compare and contrast these as if you were explaining to someone who did not understand the difference.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
