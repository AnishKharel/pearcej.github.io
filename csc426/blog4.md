## Blog Prompt 4

Read the following:
    - Read the Foreword, Preface, and A Brief History of Hackerdom in [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://monoskop.org/images/e/e0/Raymond_Eric_S_The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar_rev_ed.pdf) pp ix-17
    - Read [Committing Code: General Rules](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/3761873)

In your blog entry, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
  1. After reading the values and principles, what was your impression of them? Do you think they would contribute to productivity in smaller or bigger companies? Why?

  2. In terms of the principles, how logical is it to apply them to a real-life, full-functioning company? What issues do you see arising?

  3. In terms of the values, what other values can you think of that could contribute to the productivity goal of the Agile Manifesto?

  4. Now that you have a firm understanding of Agile software engineering, how can you apply this to our class? What about your other classes, if possible?
  
  5. How would using this manifesto improve your work? Do you think it wouldnâ€™t help? If not, please elaborate.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md) of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
