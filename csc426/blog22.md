## Blog Prompt 22

It has come to our attention that many students do not understand how HTNL, CSS, and JavaScript work together, so please consider the following:
- These two posts attempt to accomplish the same thing, so please skim both and identify which post is more useful to you: [Web Design 101: How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Work](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-design-html-css-javascript) and [The Relationship Between HTML, CSS and JavaScript Explained by Building A City](https://blog.codeanalogies.com/2018/05/09/the-relationship-between-html-css-and-javascript-explained/)
- Skim the [CSS tutorial at W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp).

In your twenty-second blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
- Which of the readings is useful to your overall understanding? Explain. To your current and likely future work with Runestone? Explain.
- Given that the readings likely did not give you everything you needed to know about HTML, CSS, and JS that might be useful in Runestone work, identify an additional reading that you see as  more helpful to you. Link it, and describe why you found it to be more helpful than the given readings.
- Make one significant change either in a CSS file or in a JS files for the websites you made earlier this semester that is posted at your Github profile. Describe what change you made and how it enhances the user experience on your site.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
