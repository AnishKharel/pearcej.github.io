Before blogging, please read the following three short documents:

- Read [Git, GitHub, & Workflow Fundamentals](https://dev.to/mollynem/git-github--workflow-fundamentals-5496)
- Read [Read Committing Code: General Rules](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/3761873)

## Blog Prompt

In your next blog entry, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):

- After hearing from Dr. Brad Miller, what are your first impressions about Runestone as an open-source project? Please explain.
- What excites you about contributing to Runestone (if anything)? Explain. 
- What worries you about contributing to Runestone (if anything)? Explain
- After reading, [Read Committing Code: General Rules](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/3761873) and [Git, GitHub, & Workflow Fundamentals](https://dev.to/mollynem/git-github--workflow-fundamentals-5496), discuss commit messages and Git workflow and their primary purposes in the context of the open-source movement. Which guidelines make the most sense to you? Which make the least sense?
- After reading [FOSS Definitions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yNo951BpIq1Kmyk8BTLN95qXJknrqkXaESGrYebyx-w/edit?usp=sharing), discuss how these definitions relate to Runestone.

### In order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

- Post your entry to your blog.
- Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)
  
The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md) of the differences
between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
  
### Please note that blog prompts are due by 8 am on their due dates --do not wait until the last minute!
