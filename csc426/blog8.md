## Blog Prompt 8

Read the following:
  -[What is Linux](https://opensource.com/resources/linux)
  -[Why Develop on Linux?](https://insights.dice.com/2017/02/24/why-develop-on-linux/)
  -[Virtualization 101: What is a Hypervisor?](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/it-ops/what-is-hypervisor)

In your eighth blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraphs each):
  - What is something that you learned or found interesting in these readings and what is something that you either found confusing or didn't understand or disagreed with?
  - Discuss your understanding of Linux and why the articles see Linux as a good choice for open source development.
  - Discuss your understanding of hypervisors, and the advantages and disadvantages for the choice of using a hypervisor for work in open source.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
