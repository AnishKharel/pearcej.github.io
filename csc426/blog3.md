In your third blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
  1. As you read, consider the following questions which we'll discuss in class Thursday:
      - Bacon focuses on two categories of communication: daily communication and longer writing.
      - What kinds of daily communication might you be doing for this class?
      - What kinds of longer writing might you be doing for this class?
  2. What are some key differences between the two styles of communication? When is one more relevant or useful than the other?
      - What is something that you learned from this reading that you'd like to incorporate into your own communication practices, going forward?

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)
  
The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md) of the differences
between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
