## Blog Prompt 12

Read the following:
- Read [Your first open source contribution: a step-by-step technical guide](https://medium.com/@jenweber/your-first-open-source-contribution-a-step-by-step-technical-guide-d3aca55cc5a6)
- Read this shorter summary: [Got Commands to Keep a Fork Up to Date](https://philna.sh/blog/2018/08/21/git-commands-to-keep-a-fork-up-to-date/)
- Read [Git 2.5, including multiple worktrees and triangular workflows](https://github.blog/2015-07-29-git-2-5-including-multiple-worktrees-and-triangular-workflows/)
- Optional reading if you want a good summary of the basics: [Understanding Git (part 1) — Explain it Like I’m Five](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-git-fcffd87c15a3)

In your twelfth blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
- Git+Github are a version control system, but they are not the first version control system, nor are they likely to be the last version  control system. Discuss their strengths as a technology and why you think they have developed such their importance in open source software.
- In your own words, explain the relation between upstream, origin, and local as if you were explaining it to someone who knows what Git and Github are, and how to use them, but doesn’t know about the triangular workflow.
- Discuss your understanding of the Git+Github workflow as well as any points of confusion you have. If you have points of confusion, identify a reading that serves to clarify them. If you do not, identify a reading (other than those we have posted) that you find a good summary. In either case, explain why you chose what you did.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
