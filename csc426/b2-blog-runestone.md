## Blog Prompt 2

Read the following:
  - [What is Linux](https://opensource.com/resources/linux)
  - [Why Develop on Linux?](https://insights.dice.com/2017/02/24/why-develop-on-linux/)
  - [What is a Docker Image](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/definition/Docker-image)
  - [Docker vs Virtual Machine â€“ Understanding the Differences](https://geekflare.com/docker-vs-virtual-machine/)


In this blog post, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraphs each):
  - Discuss your understanding of Linux and why the articles see Linux as a good choice for open source development.
  - Discuss your understanding of Docker, and the advantages and disadvantages for the choice of using Docker for work in open source.
  -  What is something that you learned or found interesting in these readings and what is something that you either found confusing or didn't understand or disagreed with?

Next find 2-3 more articles that serve to further address what you found interesting or confusing in these articles. 
 - Write at least one more paragraph that discussed what you learned from these additional sources. Link these references in your blog AND add a references section at the bottom of your post with formal APA style citations for each. 


### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
