  - Discuss your understanding of Linux and why the articles see Linux as a good choice for open source development.
  - Discuss your understanding of Docker, and the advantages and disadvantages for the choice of using Docker for work in open source.
  -  What is something that you learned or found interesting in these readings and what is something that you either found confusing or didn't understand or disagreed with?

Next find 2-3 more articles that serve to further address what you found interesting or confusing in these articles.
 - Write at least one more paragraph that discussed what you learned from these additional sources. Link these references in your blog AND add a references section at the bottom of your post with formal APA style citations for each.


### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
