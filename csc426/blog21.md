## Blog Prompt 21

No new readings! We only have a month left in our term! ðŸ˜¯ So rather than assign additional reading over the weekend, I want you to spend additional time working on your bug/issue and reporting on what you did as an individual. This is meant as a counterpoint to the Scrum blog entries, in which you comment on your team's progress as a whole. *It would be completely appropriate to coordinate what you work on with your team members on this task.*

Assign yourself a specific task or goal that you can spend several hours on this weekend. (Yeah, several hours! This is a senior level course.)

In your twenty-first blog entry of the semester, after you've spent a couple of hours working independently, write a blog entry (250+ words) which addresses the following questions in short essay form::
- What did you set out to work on? (Did you change course, once you started working? If so, why?)
- How much time did you spend and how far did you get?
- How would you like this to inform how you will spend your class time in the coming week?

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.

### This entry is due by 8 am on the day of our next class
