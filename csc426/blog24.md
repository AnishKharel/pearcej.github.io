## Blog Prompt 24

Read/Watch the following:
- [Here's why you should throw yourself a party the next time you reach a goal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2015/02/24/want-to-keep-those-resolutions-then-learn-to-celebrate-your-wins/)
- [Looking under the rug: the art of learning from failure by Isa Silveira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjgoWwQmxPI)

In your twenty-forth blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
- Thinking about your own personal style, blog about how you can benefit from celebrating your wins, and finding a way to learn from your mistakes and losses after a tragic loss.
- Discuss why you think that having losses are arguably just as valuable, if not more valuable than having wins when it comes to reaching a goal.
- Pick a win and a loss you have experienced while working on Runestone Interactive, describe the situation and explain how you feel it has helped you in this course and possibly beyond.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
