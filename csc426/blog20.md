## Blog Prompt 20

Read the following:
- [How to Manage Tasks Effectively? 10 Tips for Effective Task Management](https://www.ntaskmanager.com/blog/task-management-skills/)
- [Elon Musk's 'Timeboxing' Method to Manage Time Effectively](https://interestingengineering.com/elon-musks-timeboxing-method-to-manage-time-effectively)

In your twentieth blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
- Keeping the first of these readings in mind, describe some of the best ideas that you think are most likely to help improve output for yourself or others you work closely with.
- People struggle with managing tasks, especially when it comes to bigger projects. Remembering that no one is perfect, describe how you honestly evaluate your task management skills. What do you think you do particularly well with respect to task management? What ways do you think you  could improve with respect to task management?
- Reflect on your approach to larger projects before this term. Has this course helped you with larger projects like we are working with in Runestone? If yes, explain. If no, please suggest ways the course could be more useful to you with respect to large project work.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
