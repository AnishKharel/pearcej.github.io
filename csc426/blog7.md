## Blog Prompt 7

Read the following:
  - In the Cathedral and the Bazaar read [Appendix A: How to Become a
    Hacker](https://monoskop.org/images/e/e0/Raymond_Eric_S_The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar_rev_ed.pdf) pp. 195-213

In your seventh blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
  - According to Raymond, what is a hacker? How about a cracker? How do these definitions differ from what you thought before reading this essay, if at all?
  - What are some of the key characteristics of a hacker mindset/attitude and what are some hard skills that Raymond believes hackers should develop?
  - What are some ways that hackers can gain status/credibility within their communities?
  - What are your reactions/responses to this reading? Explain.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
