- Describe the four Scrum ceremonies and elaborate on how you believe each of these ceremonies may aid you and our class while working on RunestoneServer and books.
- Describe how each of the ceremonies rely on each other and why you think this agile process was designed this way.
- Focusing on the graphic in the reading, describe how scrum works in a software development environment. Then compare and contrast to how it might server us in our classroom.
- Locate an additional scrum resource that you find interesting or helpful. Explain why you selected it. What was interesting or helpful in it.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
