## Create a new WordPress Blog

Create a new publicly accessible blog on a blogging platform such as WordPress. 
If you use WordPress, start by visiting wordpress.com and clicking Get Started.
Note: Do not use a non-blogging platform like Google Docs.

Make sure that your blog is public, or else the TAs and I won't be able to see your posts. 
It's up to you whether you would like to use your real name or not. 
You're free to blog under a pseudonym as long as we know what it is.
Submit a link to your blog in Moodle.

You can be less formal in your blog posts than if you were writing a paper or report. 
However, your grade will take into account the level of critical reflection as well as the level of professionalism. 
In other words, errors in punctuation, formatting, spelling, and a professional tone still matter!

The [Runestone Roadmap 2021](https://runestoneinteractive.org/2021/04/28/roadmap_2021.html) post gives you a
good sense of where Runestone is headed. 

## Blog Prompt 1

In your first blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):

  - Do you have any prior experience with open source? If so, what is it? (It's okay if you don't have any at all!)
  - We will be contributing to Runestone Academy this term. Which of the projects in [Runestone Roadmap 2021](https://runestoneinteractive.org/2021/04/28/roadmap_2021.html) seem interesting to you? Explain why they are of interest.
  - What do you think is the strongest skill or characteristic that you can bring to your work in this course this semester?
  - What skill or characteristic would you most like to improve upon? What can you do this semester to help in that endeavor?

### In order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)
  
The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md) of the differences
between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
  
### Please note that blog prompts are due by 8 am on their due dates --do not wait until the last minute! 
This first entry is due by 8 am on Tuesday, August 24, 2021
