## Blog Prompt 18

Watch/Read the following:
- Academic Coach, Mamie Morrow's TEDx talk [Why Self-Efficacy Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agwsjYg9hJ8)
- [Computer Anxiety, Self-Efficacy, Computer Experience: An investigation throughout a Computer Science degree ](http://archive.fie-conference.org/fie2005/papers/1693.pdf)

In your eighteenth blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
- Identify Bandura's all four sources of efficacy that were discussed in the video. Then discuss which of these sources of efficacy you are typically good at finding/achieving/doing intrinsically for yourself and which you sometimes might benefit from working harder at for yourself. Explain perhaps with an example.
- Have you ever experienced anxiety about a task and/or lack of self-efficacy regarding that task? (This time might or might not relate to computer science.) Reflect on what factors caused you to feel that way. How has your perception of computer science and yourself as a programmer evolved over your 3-4 years of your undergraduate career?
- Describe a time you have felt a great sense of self-efficacy. (This example might or might not relate to computer science.) Based on that experience, explain why you believe having good self-efficacy will help you and your team in regards to completing your current Runestone project. Drawing upon the materials you read and watched, how you might be able to support others in your team improve their own self-efficacy.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
