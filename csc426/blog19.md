## Blog Prompt 19

Read the following:
- Read Chapter 4 "Processes: Simple is Sustainable" in [the Art of Community](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EI6YcKlTdzojLD4RdVjYVlmFRTNzzge0/view?usp=sharing) pgs 97-131.

In your nineteenth blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
- Discuss why the author asserts that simple is sustainable. Do you agree? Disagree? Explain.
- Using the criteria from the reading for developing a process and without talking with your teammates, brainstorm a draft process for ensuring that tasks get done properly within your Runestone Team. (You will discuss each of your draft processes in the next class.)
- Leverage the reading to brainstorm creative ways that open source teams might better gear their on-ramp to help bring in more new open source software developers.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
