## Final Portfolio

Submit a single-spaced portfolio document to Moodle which includes the following sections:

# An overview of the issue or issues that your team worked on and summary of the progress your team made (if any; if none, then summarize each of your attempts). Assume that your reader has general familiarity with the Runestone, but nothing more. If helpful, you can include images or screenshots. (2+ paragraphs)

# A detailed summary of each team member's contributions, including your own. I'm interested in what you each did rather than your dynamics, which you'll address in your Final Team Evaluation. (3+ paragraphs; 1+ on each team member)

# Links to the two blog entries that you are most proud of and would feel comfortable sharing with a potential employer. Include a paragraph explaining why you chose these two entries. (link + 1 paragraph)

# A reflection on your overall experience in the class and working on Runestone. You are free to highlight what is most important to you, although be sure to answer the following at minimum (1 page):

  - What is the most valuable or interesting thing you learned this term from this project?
  - What changes would you like to see in the class structure the next time it is offered?
  - What advice would you give to a future Open Source Software Engineering student?

Because I do not measure your success in PRs, your portfolio helps me to understand in a broader sense what you have accomplished this term. You should consider it a professional document; it should be well-written, well-edited, and entirely your own writing. (Remember that along with your team's presentation, it is worth 25% of your course grade!)
