## Blog Prompt 17

Read the following:
- [Intrinsic Motivation in Open Source Software Development](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596706000643) Note: You may need to be logged in to Berea get to this.
- [Why Hackers Do What They Do: Understanding Motivation and Effort in Free/Open Source Software Projects ](http://www.ocw.nur.ac.rw/NR/rdonlyres/Sloan-School-of-Management/15-352Spring-2005/D2C127A9-B712-4ACD-AA82-C57DE2844B8B/0/lakhaniwolf.pdf)

In your seventeenth blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
- Discuss the motivations developers have for writing for OSS that are explored in the readings. Compare and contrast your own motivations and traits with those explored in the readings.
-  One of the readings states that "enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation, namely how creative a person feels when working on the project, is the strongest and most pervasive driver." Think of a time you did a big job or project solely based out of enjoyment. (Your example need not necessarily be in programming) Explain why you chose to tackle this job or project.
- Identify what you consider to be blockers in your life or career that sometimes hinder you or your motivation. Elaborate on what you might consider doing to overcome those blockers.


### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
