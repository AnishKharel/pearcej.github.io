In your fifteenth blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
- Describe why you think programmers don't want to ask for help.  What are some ways you think we can encourage such programmers to seek help when they need it.
- Pick a time you have ever felt inadequate to a task or a time when you may have experienced imposter syndrome--these times need not have anything to do with computer science. Explain how you felt and what where some things you did to get rid of that feeling. Or if you still feel that way, what are some things you are doing to help you overcome this mentality?
- Thinking about taking on a more challenging task in Runestone: a) what are some challenges that you might encounter while solving this issue in terms of dynamics, varied expertise, or otherwise? b) What steps can you take to address each of these if they arise? (Describe in detail the steps you would take.) c) What are some technical challenges that you anticipate as you begin working on this larger task in Runestone. d) Discuss in detail some strategies for overcoming the technical challenges that you anticipate.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
