## Day 5: Friday, August 30, 2019

Before class:
  - Complete all work due before class today (see list from last time)

In class:
  - Take Quiz on Chapters 5 and 6 of [C++ for Python Programmers](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/cpp4python/index.html) Be sure to read while logged in.
  - Share art from [L01: ASCII Art](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14j_z0Q-HcVHP9KLok0PGk6o7U3wKpC7BN_tygccKfK8/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Begin and maybe complete [T03: Debugging Techniques](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T0BS2SzKxoOXg_EpfDCpFd8UG219_Jbqzl8W1kogtcc/edit?usp=sharing)

Outside of class:
  - Register for our next Runestone book. Read Chapter 1 in [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using C++](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/cppds/index.html) in preparation for a reading quiz. Be sure to use our course cppdsS20, and a login using your Berea email and username. Note: You can safely skip sections 1.7-1.11 because longer versions of these all appeared in our first other book. I recommend reading 1.12 the most carefully because it introduces OOP and classes. 1.13 is a much harder read, so just get the main ideas and you will be fine on the quiz.
