  - Complete all work due before class today (see list from last time)

Outside of class:
  - Register for our next Runestone book. Read Chapter 1 in [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using C++](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/cppds/index.html) in preparation for a reading quiz. Be sure to use our course cppdsS20, and a login using your Berea email and username. Note: You can safely skip sections 1.7-1.11 because longer versions of these all appeared in our first other book. I recommend reading 1.12 the most carefully because it introduces OOP and classes. 1.13 is a much harder read, so just get the main ideas and you will be fine on the quiz.
