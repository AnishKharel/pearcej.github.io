## How we will work after Friday, March 13, 2020 when we can't meet face-to-face

- **Class, Office Hours, and Evening Lab**:  Attendance will NOT be required  by either via Slack or Zoom, but I will appear at 9:20 every MWF on my Zoom channel. Attendance is NOT required, but if no one joins by 9:30, I may leave. This will replace my office hours and lab, If you want asynchronous help, please use our slack channel or email me.
- **Support**: Just email me or direct message me in our slack channel by using @pearcej. I will support you do don't hesitate to contact me--people learn much more when they ask for help than when they need help and don't ask.
- **Discussion**: Use our slack channel for class discussion - anything you would have said in class is appropriate here. This might be I need a partner for X or can we have an extension on y, etc.
- **Teamworks**: The BC CS teamworks use a teaching strategy called POGIL (Process oriented guided inquiry based learning) Research indicates POGIL is highly effective for learning, but the learning needs to be synchronous for discussions. Hence, I encourage you to join a partner or two, but not more for teamworks. You may also do them alone if need be, Most are already posted.
- **Exam 2**: Only the Peerwise portion will occur. Engagement with Peerwise will be required. This percentage of your grade will be reapportioned.
- **Text book**: The remainder of the text will be read, but all quizzes will be replaced by assignments.  
- **Labs and assignments**: These will still happen. All labs have been posted. Most assignments are already posted.
- **Project**: We will still do this in teams of 1, 2, or 3, but the coding portion is canceled and the amount of impact on your grade is reduced.
- **Mindset**: Support will be there and you can do this!!
- **Flexibility**: I plan to be extremely flexible due to the unprecedented situation. Please tell me if you are sick, or need an extension or an incomplete.
