## About section

Add biographical information to your Application Development section. In many
software releases, you will find an “About the Team” section. In such a section, brief biographical
information is offered about each team member. This biographical information is almost always written
in the third person, though it can still be very personal and can give insight into the person’s personality
and character.

See examples at:
  - [https://www.coffeecup.com/about/](https://www.coffeecup.com/about/)
  - [https://www.khanacademy.org/about/the-team](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/the-team)
http://www.coffeecup.com/about/.

Note that a photo or avatar may be used, but be sure not to include
copyrighted material in any avatar. Since our projects have a single author, we will not call the section
“About the Team.” Instead, you will need to choose an appropriate title for the section depending upon
your future plans for the software, considering such titles as “About the Author” or “Lead Developer.”

## More Software development

As mentioned before, all agile design methodologies
recommend breaking systems down into small units.

Fully implement another small portion(s) of your project. As always, it is required that this component has internal documentation though comment lines.

Be sure to identify which component you have fully implemented in your Scrum report.

### Submission Deadline:
- *Before next class:*
  - Scrum report that does the usual and also clearly identifies the newly coded component.
  - About section
  - Commit the code for the newly completed component with header-style descriptions in each software component as well as internal documentation though comment lines. This is submitted to Github.
