## Your Video(s):
We would normally have had both a poster session where you would demo your software AND a video demo, but given COVID-19, I have decided to collapse them into a single video demo.

Because of COVID-19, you will not need to do a poster, but this means the requirements for the video demo had to change.
- This [set of video demos](http://cs.berea.edu/courses/csc493-older/schedule.html) is older now, but most of the videos still exist. Watch some of them to get ideas and think about what you think is effective and what is not. Just bear in mind, they were only doing the demo and not the poster session too.
- Read [12 tips for killer software demos](https://www.cio.com/article/3074817/12-tips-for-killer-software-demos.html) and reflect on how to make a great video demo that really showcases the best parts of your prototype.

## Video Details
- You must make **1 or 2 videos** and post them publically on YouTube. One can be the software demo and the other can be the replacement poster session or you can do both in one video. Think about what makes sense to you.
- It is fine for you to record your video(s) with a cell phone or with the free Zoom app. It is best if you **stabilize the recording device** by using a tripod or by putting your recording device on a table leaning on something. Do not have a friend hold it because it will be shaky.
- All videos must be **posted publicly to YouTube** and the auto-generated transcripts must be corrected. The video will be copied and reposted by the department unless you have a compelling reason that it should not be publicly posted or reposted and you successfully formally protest to the department about public posting or reposting.
- I would normally *require* a draft script as I do in CSC 236, but time is short, so I am not. I still *recommend* making one in advance. See [
How To Make A Video About How To Make A Video About How To Make A
Video About How To Make a Video...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZ5rsAHMl4 ) to see what an internationally known video blogger has to say on this topic. For reasons of accessibility, you are be required to **correct the auto-generated YouTube transcript**.
- **Credits must be given** on each video in a professional way. These credits should include your name as well as acknowledgement of Berea College and any thanks you wish to give to anyone. Be sure to include all software and open source projects you leveraged.
- Your total video time should run **between 8.0-12.0 minutes**. (So if you do 2 videos, they need to total to less than this in length.) Remember that longer does not equate to better! Editing is good!!
- Each video must have an **informative YouTube title** which indicates the actual software project topic. Projects that have a video topic like "Final Project" or "1234.mpg" will be significantly downgraded. Having said this you can still have fun with the title, it just need to explain the software.
- Each video must have a **title screen** with the title, which also should indicate the actual topic of your project.
- The vast majority of your video(s) should be your amazing video content.
- All music in each video must be original or open source with credits given. I take this seriously, so steer **clear of using proprietary music**! There is a good amount of open source music out there-just search for it if you want to use music.
- Please note that each video is your intellectual property, which means you can use it later and link to it from your LinkedIn page and/or website, and I hope that you are proud of it so you will do so. However, Bereaâ€™s CS department may also make a copy and post it publicly giving you credit.

## Required Video Content
- You must show all of the following regarding the software and hardware integration:
  - How to **install** the software.
  - How to **use** the software.
  - How the project **meets the goals** you set. (If you need to reduce the goals, you need to do so in the documentation!)
- Regarding the poster replacement, you must address the following questions. Please do this in some kind of natural way as you would have done personally in a poster session.
  - Discuss the **motivation** for your software and why it is important to you and to the larger society. (Here you should give a SHORT (1 paragraph) overview of why you chose to work on what you did.
  - What is the **single most important non-technical thing you learned** during your work on this project? Please explain its importance.
  - What are the **three most important technical things you learned** during your internship? Please explain their importance using details as if you are talking to a strong student who has completed Data Structures.
  - What  things did you **learn about yourself** as you worked on this project?
  - What is the primary thing that you feel **most proud of** that you accomplished during your work on this project?
