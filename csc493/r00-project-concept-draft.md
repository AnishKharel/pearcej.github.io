## CSC 493: R00: Project Concept Proposal DRAFT

As you know from the course title, this course is a project-based course.
It will be a project that you develop
as a solo developer using Agile methods.
You may already have a definite idea of what you would like to do
for your project or you may not.
Either is fine...
The instructor has multiple ideas of possible
projects that are at the appropriate
level even if you do not.

The **Project Concept Proposal** is typically used to make a case for a project and it is frequently the first document to be created in the software development life cycle.

The first project milestone requirement is that your project concept
be approved by the instructor and that the project is likely to involves work
at the level worthy of a CIS senior but which can be completed in the
rather short time frame of a single semester.
Hence, while it should be something you can be proud of, it should not be an unreasonably large project.

This assignment is that you [pull the repo here](https://classroom.github.com/a/3_PDFE8Y) and use the README.md to create your first draft of your project concept proposal. Note that Github README files are typically written in
an easy language called MarkDown. Here is a [MarkDown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) which includes a [MarkDown Live Demo](http://www.markdown-here.com/livedemo.html).

The **Project Concept Proposal** is frequently the first document to be created in the software development life cycle. In industry, it concretely identifies a need or opportunity and
demonstrates that the idea is likely to be a worthwhile investment by identifying potential impacts on company
systems, staff, and operations. In short it is used to:
- Explain the rationale behind the proposed software product/service.
- Persuade stakeholders to invest resources in the proposal
- Highlight where strategic goals can be realized and justify why this proposal should be endorsed
Your task is to decide on a programming project and write a project concept proposal first draft.

As you consider what you wish to propose for your project,
keep in mind the following suggestions:

- *Make something you think is awesome or fills a real desire
or need:*

You will be spending a great deal of time working on this project,
and its easier to get motivated for the amount of work required if its something
that you care about. Don't treat this as just an assignment
you have to do to fulfill a requirement.
Try to do something that you and/or others will care about:
a useful project that you can contribute as open source, a game application,
a Facebook plug-in, or tool for a non-profit, etc...
Remember if you can create an interesting project you are proud of,
you can put it in your resume and talk about it in a job interview situation.

- *Use what you already know:*

One goal of this project is to bring together different things you have
learned to create something new and interesting.
Identify your strengths and then think about how to use them to your advantage.  By leveraging your strengths you will have an easier time with a project of this large scope.

- *Don't be afraid to learn something new:*

It is not sufficient just to learn something new, but
don't be afraid to learn a new language, like Django or C#,
or a new framework or an important API, like Facebook or Google gadgets

The instructor can help talk you through what's involved in your project
to help you to determine if it is reasonableâ€¦

The following are a few general ideas designed just to get you thinking about your project.
This list reflects some of my biases about what I find interesting,
and you should feel free to expand far beyond my list.
Your project proposal will need to be far more specific than this,
but hopefully this will get you thinking.

- Develop a web application to manage a collection of a particular type of document and relation between documents, with ratings, tagging, and/or commenting capabilities.  This might, for example, improve storage of photos and/or videos.
- Implement an fun and interesting game program with a solid intuitive GUI interface.
- Work with a Berea faculty member to develop software for their classroom or for their research.
- Write a Moodle plug-in that does something significant and useful (for example, manages programming assignments and submissions in some new way).
- Expand an Open Source application by adding some significant functionality which is currently lacking.
- Make an iPhone or Android application.
- The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual program in which Google
awards stipends to students who successfully complete a free software or
open-source coding project during a summer. Google it.
- Develop the next amazing web application that will make you and your Project Director a lot of money... Ha, ha!  Well, why not?
