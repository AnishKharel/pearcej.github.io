## R07: Software Component 2

You have two tasks to complete before next time:
- Complete agile report
- Complete another new software component, which can again be small.

## Documentation

README.md
- Project name
- Project proposal (including purpose)
- Vision
- Scope
- Prerequisites
- Built With
- Author name
- Acknowledgments
- Concept (linked to concept.md)
    - Goals
    - Context
    - Novelty
    - Functionality
    - Audience
    - Challenges
    - Measures
    - Motivation
    - Future Extensions
    - *Other (Optional)*
- Requirements (linked to requirements.md)
  - formal list of requirements
- Design (linked to design.md)

As mentioned last time, all agile design methodologies
recommend breaking systems down into small units.

So, today's work will be to fully implement another small portion(s) of your project. As always, it is required that this component has internal documentation though comment lines.

Be sure to identify which component you have fully implemented in your Scrum report.

### Submission Deadline:
- *Before next class:*
  - Scrum report that does the usual and also clearly identifies the newly coded component.
  - Commit the code for the newly completed component with header-style descriptions in each software component as well as internal documentation though comment lines. This is submitted to Github.
