## Continuing Software development

As mentioned before, all agile design methodologies recommend breaking systems down into small units.

Fully implement another portion(s) of your project. As always, it is required that code components have internal documentation though comment lines.

Be sure to goal set and identify which component you have fully implemented in your Scrum report.
