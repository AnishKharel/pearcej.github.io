## R03: Complete SRS and begin Software Development

You have two tasks to complete before next time:
- Complete the Preliminary Software Requirements Specification (SRS) which you began last time. You will add to the file called requirements.md.
- You must also begin your software development

## Documentation

README.md
- Project name
- Project proposal (including purpose)
- Vision
- Scope
- Prerequisites
- Built With
- Author name
- Acknowledgments
- Concept (linked to concept.md)
    - Goals
    - Context
    - Novelty
    - Functionality
    - Audience
    - Challenges
    - Measures
    - Motivation
    - Future Extensions
    - *Other (Optional)*
- Requirements (linked to requirements.md)
  - formal list of requirements

Complete the set of Software Requirements Specification (SRS)  

As we discussed, the SRS are typically prioritized on as well as numbered so
that they can be tracked as the project moves forward.

Create a new file called requirements.md.
Using your stated Scope as a guide, precisely and explicitly describe the primary software requirements using the following template for each specific requirement:

  - **Number**: (List unique requirement number.)
  - **Statement**: (Precisely state the requirement.)
  - **Evaluation Method**: (How can you tell if the completed software satisfies this requirement?)
  - **Dependency**: (List each other requirement on which satisfaction of this requirement depends or write "None")
  - **Priority**: (Assign a priority to this requirement: essential, high, middle, low, or if time permits.)
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)

Be sure that you list each requirement separately rather than combining two or more.

You may want to use [MarkDown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) and [MarkDown Live Demo](http://www.markdown-here.com/livedemo.html).

You should also have a relative link to requirements.md from README.md. (A relative link uses just the file name and not http://...) Test this link and make sure it works.

## Begin Software development

There is no length requirement for how much software you write before next time.

### Submission Deadline:
- *Before next class:*
  - Completed set of requirements in requirement.md. All submitted to your linked Github repo.
  - Begin software development.
