## Project Proposal Information and Suggestions

Some of you may already have a definite idea of what you would like to do
for your project, while others of you may have not.
Even if you already have a general idea of what you want to do,
the design specifications can still be challenging.
The main project proposal requirement is that your project concept
be approved by the instructor and that the project involves new learning
at the level worthy of a CIS senior as well as strong design and
implementation components
(so such tasks like creating a simple webpage or fixing bugs in a small
existing project will not be acceptable).
Of course, you need to choose a project which can be completed in the
rather short time frame of a single semester,
so it should not be a massively large project.

As you consider what you wish to propose for your project,
keep in mind the following suggestions:

- *Make your project something you think is awesome or fills a real desire
or need*
You will be spending a great deal of time working on this project,
and its easier to get motivated for the amount of work required if its something
that you care about. Don't treat this as just an assignment
you have to do to fulfill a requirement.
Try to do something that you and/or others will care about:
a useful project that you can contribute as open source, a game application,
a Facebook plug-in, or tool for a non-profit, etc...
Remember if you can create an interesting project you are proud of,
you can put it in your resume and talk about it in a job interview situation.

- *Use what you already know:*
One goal of this project is to bring together different things you have
learned to create something new and interesting.
Identify your strengths and then think about how to use them to your advantage.  By leveraging your strengths you will have an easier time with a project of this large scope.

- *Don't be afraid to learn something new:*
It is not sufficient just to learn something new, but
don't be afraid to learn a new language, like PHP or Java,
or a new framework/API, like Facebook or Google gadgets

The instructor can help talk you through what's involved in your project
to help you to determine if it is reasonableâ€¦

The following are a few  general ideas designed just to get you thinking about your project.
This list reflects some of my biases about what I find interesting,
and you should feel free to expand far beyond my list.
Your project proposal will need to be far more specific than this,
but hopefully this will get you thinking.

- Develop a web application to manage a collection of a particular type of documents and relations between documents, with ratings, tagging, and commenting capabilities.  This might, for example, improve storage of photos and/or videos.
- Implement an interesting game program with a solid intuitive GUI interface.
- Work with a Berea faculty member to develop software for their classroom or for their research.
- Write a Moodle plug-in that does something useful (for example, manages programming assignments and submissions in some new way).
- Expand an Open Source application by adding some particular functionality which is currently lacking.
- Make a cool iPhone or Android application.
- Develop the next amazing web application that will make you and your Project Director a billion dollars. Ha, ha!  Well, why not?
- The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual program in which Google
awards stipends to students who successfully complete a free software or
open-source coding project during a summer. Google it.
