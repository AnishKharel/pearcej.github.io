## Installation and Use Guide
Write a guide that steps a typical user through how to install your software. In your final video, you will be demoing the installation, so here do not use a video. Instead, show the installation in a typical case in writing. Screen shots are likely to be very useful here.

Next, detail in writing a few of the typical use cases of your software. Screen shots are likely to be helpful here too. Be sure to highlight the features that work well rather on dwelling on features that you wish you had time to implement in this prototype.

## More Software development

Work toward finalizing your project. As always, it is required that internal documentation though comment lines is required.

Be sure to highlight what you have accomplished and where you are stuck in your Scrum report.
