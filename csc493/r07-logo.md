How to choose a product logo?
- Read [Ten Tips for Choosing a Logo](https://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/logo_tips.htm)
- Read [How to design a logo: the ultimate guide](https://99designs.com/blog/logo-branding/how-to-design-logo/)
- Make your logo and commit it to Github. Be sure you do NOT violate copyright law in making your logo.
- Embed this logo in your README.md using a relative link that is begun with an exclamation mark. See the image section on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

As mentioned last time, all agile design methodologies
recommend breaking systems down into small units.

Fully implement another small portion(s) of your project. As always, it is required that this component has internal documentation though comment lines.

Be sure to identify which component you have fully implemented in your Scrum report.

### Submission Deadline:
- *Before next class:*
  - Scrum report that does the usual and also clearly identifies the newly coded component.
  - Commit the code for the newly completed component with header-style descriptions in each software component as well as internal documentation though comment lines. This is submitted to Github.
