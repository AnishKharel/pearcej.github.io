##  One Page Test Plan

The first section of the One Page Test Plan should be a clearly written summary of the testing activities and the overall approach to the testing.

##  One Page Test Plan Key Test Cases

Read [The One Page Test Plan](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/the-one-page-test-plan)

Create your One Page Test Plan in testplan.md. Link this from index.md and link it to requirements.md.

The majority of your One Page Test Plan should be focused on
creating the Key Test Cases, which each provide a specific description of the key interactions with the software that a tester plans to do in order to test one single behavior of the software. See [Project Test Plan](https://d2h1nbmw1jjnl.cloudfront.net/ckeditor/pictures/data/000/000/067/content/trello_project_plan.jpg) for an example of a set of key test cases created in a Trello board.

A typical key test case is usually laid out in a table or bulleted format and contains:
- A unique name and number (which may be related to the requirement number, but are typically
not identical.
- The specific requirement that this Test Case is intended to test.
- Preconditions which detail which state of the software needs to be in to exercise the Test Case
(sometimes this is a previous Test Case that must always be run before the current Test Case.)
- Steps that describe the specific steps that make up the interaction with the software to run the
Test Case
- The desired results that describe the desired state of the software after the Test Case is executed
successfully

## More Software development

Fully implement another small portion(s) of your project. As always, it is required that this component has internal documentation though comment lines.

Be sure to identify which component you have fully implemented in your Scrum report.

---
### Submission Deadline:
- *Before next class:*
  - Scrum report that does the usual and also clearly identifies the newly coded component.
  - Commit the code for the newly completed component with header-style descriptions in each software component as well as internal documentation though comment lines. This is submitted to Github.
  - Complete your One Page Test Plan as described above. Be sure to commit to Github.
