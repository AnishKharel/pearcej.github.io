This week we are finally require to implement some complete software portion of your project which can be small, but it must be complete.

There are a number of design methodologies in software development. However, all good methodologies use a technique of
implementing and testing small components. Agile software development is a group of software development methodologies based on iterative and incremental development. In this methodology, software evolves incrementally, and both the
requirements and the solutions evolve through frequent contact and collaboration between the programming team and the client team.

The technique for writing a program using a top-down method is to write a main procedure that names
all the major functions it will need. After testing the main program with stubs, the functions are each
codes as subroutines or methods. When all the various subroutines and methods have been coded and
tested the program is complete.

The bottom-up method works kind of in reverse. In bottom-up
programming, you build the language up toward your final program by first creating methods and
functions which will help you to achieve small goals needed by the program. So, in bottom-up
programming an application is constructed starting with existing primitives of the programming
language, and constructing gradually more and more complicated features, until the all of the project application has been written.

There are other methodologies as wellâ€¦ feel free to Google them. But suffice it to say, they all
recommend breaking systems down into small units. So, today's work will be to fully implement some small portion(s) of your project. Of course, it is required that this component has internal documentation though comment lines.

Be sure to identify which component you have fully implemented in your Scrum report.

### Submission Deadline:
- *Before next class:*
  - Scrum report that does the usual and also clearly identifies the newly coded component.
  - Commit the code for your newly completed component with header-style descriptions in each software component as well as internal documentation though comment lines. This is submitted to Github.
